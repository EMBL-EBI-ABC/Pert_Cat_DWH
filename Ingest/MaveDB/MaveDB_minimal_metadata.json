            "We present a large-scale approach to investigate the functional consequences of sequence variation in a protein. The approach entails the display of hundreds of thousands of protein variants, moderate selection for activity and high-throughput DNA sequencing to quantify the performance of each variant. Using this strategy, we tracked the performance of >600,000 variants of a human WW domain after three and six rounds of selection by phage display for binding to its peptide ligand. Binding properties of these variants defined a high-resolution map of mutational preference across the WW domain; each position had unique features that could not be captured by a few representative mutations. Our approach could be applied to many in vitro or in vivo protein assays, providing a general means for understanding how protein function relates to sequence.",
            "The ability of a protein to carry out a given function results from fundamental physicochemical properties that include the protein's structure, mechanism of action, and thermodynamic stability. Traditional approaches to study these properties have typically required the direct measurement of the property of interest, oftentimes a laborious undertaking. Although protein properties can be probed by mutagenesis, this approach has been limited by its low throughput. Recent technological developments have enabled the rapid quantification of a protein's function, such as binding to a ligand, for numerous variants of that protein. Here, we measure the ability of 47,000 variants of a WW domain to bind to a peptide ligand and use these functional measurements to identify stabilizing mutations without directly assaying stability. Our approach is rooted in the well-established concept that protein function is closely related to stability. Protein function is generally reduced by destabilizing mutations, but this decrease can be rescued by stabilizing mutations. Based on this observation, we introduce partner potentiation, a metric that uses this rescue ability to identify stabilizing mutations, and identify 15 candidate stabilizing mutations in the WW domain. We tested six candidates by thermal denaturation and found two highly stabilizing mutations, one more stabilizing than any previously known mutation. Thus, physicochemical properties such as stability are latent within these large-scale protein functional data and can be revealed by systematic analysis. This approach should allow other protein properties to be discovered."

            "Interpreting variants of uncertain significance (VUS) is a central challenge in medical genetics. One approach is to experimentally measure the functional consequences of VUS, but to date this approach has been post hoc and low throughput. Here we use massively parallel assays to measure the effects of nearly 2000 missense substitutions in the RING domain of BRCA1 on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and its binding to the BARD1 RING domain. From the resulting scores, we generate a model to predict the capacities of full-length BRCA1 variants to support homology-directed DNA repair, the essential role of BRCA1 in tumor suppression, and show that it outperforms widely used biological-effect prediction algorithms. We envision that massively parallel functional assays may facilitate the prospective interpretation of variants observed in clinical sequencing.",

Here we demonstrate programmed allelic series (PALS), a single-volume, site-directed mutagenesis approach using microarray-programmed oligonucleotides. We created libraries including nearly every missense mutation as singleton events for the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (99.9% coverage) and human tumor suppressor p53 (93.5%). PALS-based comprehensive missense mutational scans may aid structure-function studies, protein engineering, and the interpretation of variants identified by clinical sequencing.",

A long DNA fragment library is converted to a population of nested sublibraries, and a tag sequence directs grouping of short reads derived from the same long fragment, enabling localized assembly of long fragment sequences. Subassembly may facilitate accurate de novo genome assembly and metagenome sequencing."

            "Interpreting variants of uncertain significance (VUS) is a central challenge in medical genetics. One approach is to experimentally measure the functional consequences of VUS, but to date this approach has been post hoc and low throughput. Here we use massively parallel assays to measure the effects of nearly 2000 missense substitutions in the RING domain of BRCA1 on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and its binding to the BARD1 RING domain. From the resulting scores, we generate a model to predict the capacities of full-length BRCA1 variants to support homology-directed DNA repair, the essential role of BRCA1 in tumor suppression, and show that it outperforms widely used biological-effect prediction algorithms. We envision that massively parallel functional assays may facilitate the prospective interpretation of variants observed in clinical sequencing.",

Here we demonstrate programmed allelic series (PALS), a single-volume, site-directed mutagenesis approach using microarray-programmed oligonucleotides.

To identify the molecular determinants within E3 ligases that modulate activity, we scored each member of a library of nearly 100,000 protein variants of the murine ubiquitination factor E4B (Ube4b) U-box domain for auto-ubiquitination activity in the presence of the E2 UbcH5c. This assay identified mutations that enhance activity both in vitro and in cellular p53 degradation assays. The activity-enhancing mutations fall into two distinct mechanistic classes: One increases the U-box:E2-binding affinity, and the other allosterically stimulates the formation of catalytically active conformations of the E2\u223cUb conjugate. The same mutations enhance E3 activity in the presence of another E2, Ube2w, implying a common allosteric mechanism, and therefore the general applicability of our observations to other E3s. A comparison of the E3 activity with the two different E2s identified an additional variant that exhibits E3:E2 specificity. Our results highlight the general utility of high-throughput mutagenesis in delineating the molecular basis of enzyme activity.",

            "In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, beneficial mutations selected during sulfate-limited growth are typically amplifications of the SUL1 gene, which encodes the high-affinity sulfate transporter, resulting in fitness increases of >35% . Cis-regulatory mutations have not been observed at this locus; however, it is not clear whether this absence is due to a low mutation rate such that these mutations do not arise, or they arise but have limited fitness effects relative to those of amplification. To address this question directly, we assayed the fitness effects of nearly all possible point mutations in a 493-base segment of the gene's promoter through mutagenesis and selection. While most mutations were either neutral or detrimental during sulfate-limited growth, eight mutations increased fitness >5% and as much as 9.4%. Combinations of these beneficial mutations increased fitness only up to 11%. Thus, in the case of SUL1, promoter mutations could not induce a fitness increase similar to that of gene amplification. Using these data, we identified functionally important regions of the SUL1 promoter and analyzed three sites that correspond to potential binding sites for the transcription factors Met32 and Cbf1 Mutations that create new Met32- or Cbf1-binding sites also increased fitness. Some mutations in the untranslated region of the SUL1 transcript decreased fitness, likely due to the formation of inhibitory upstream open reading frames. Our methodology-saturation mutagenesis, chemostat selection, and DNA sequencing to track variants-should be a broadly applicable approach.",
            "We demonstrate subassembly, an in vitro library construction method that extends the utility of short-read sequencing platforms to applications requiring long, accurate reads. A long DNA fragment library is converted to a population of nested sublibraries, and a tag sequence directs grouping of short reads derived from the same long fragment, enabling localized assembly of long fragment sequences. Subassembly may facilitate accurate de novo genome assembly and metagenome sequencing."

        "pub_abstract": "The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA-binding domain in eukaryotes. Differences in RRM sequences dictate, in part, both RNA and protein-binding specificities and affinities. We used a deep mutational scanning approach to study the sequence-function relationship of the RRM2 domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1). By scoring the activity of more than 100,000 unique Pab1 variants, including 1246 with single amino acid substitutions, we delineated the mutational constraints on each residue. Clustering of residues with similar mutational patterns reveals three major classes, composed principally of RNA-binding residues, of hydrophobic core residues, and of the remaining residues. The first class also includes a highly conserved residue not involved in RNA binding, G150, which can be mutated to destabilize Pab1. A comparison of the mutational sensitivity of yeast Pab1 residues to their evolutionary conservation reveals that most residues tolerate more substitutions than are present in the natural sequences, although other residues that tolerate fewer substitutions may point to specialized functions in yeast. An analysis of \u223c40,000 double mutants indicates a preference for a short distance between two mutations that display an epistatic interaction. As examples of interactions, the mutations N139T, N139S, and I157L suppress other mutations that interfere with RNA binding and protein stability. Overall, this study demonstrates that living cells can be subjected to a single assay to analyze hundreds of thousands of protein variants in parallel.",

            "The genes of all organisms have been shaped by selective pressures. The relationship between gene sequence and fitness has tremendous implications for understanding both evolutionary processes and functional constraints on the encoded proteins. Here, we have exploited deep sequencing technology to experimentally determine the fitness of all possible individual point mutants under controlled conditions for a nine-amino acid region of Hsp90. Over the past five decades, limited glimpses into the relationship between gene sequence and function have sparked a long debate regarding the distribution, relative proportion, and evolutionary significance of deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations. Our systematic experimental measurement of fitness effects of Hsp90 mutants in yeast, evaluated in the light of existing population genetic theory, are remarkably consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.",
            "The amino acid sequence of a protein governs its function. We used bulk competition and focused deep sequencing to investigate the effects of all ubiquitin point mutants on yeast growth rate. Many aspects of ubiquitin function have been carefully studied, which enabled interpretation of our growth analyses in light of a rich structural, biophysical and biochemical knowledge base. In one highly sensitive cluster on the surface of ubiquitin, almost every amino acid substitution caused growth defects. In contrast, the opposite face tolerated virtually all possible substitutions. Surface locations between these two faces exhibited intermediate mutational tolerance. The sensitive face corresponds to the known interface for many binding partners. Across all surface positions, we observe a strong correlation between burial at structurally characterized interfaces and the number of amino acid substitutions compatible with robust growth. This result indicates that binding is a dominant determinant of ubiquitin function. In the solvent-inaccessible core of ubiquitin, all positions tolerated a limited number of substitutions, with hydrophobic amino acids especially interchangeable. Some mutations null for yeast growth were previously shown to populate folded conformations indicating that, for these mutants, subtle changes to conformation caused functional defects. The most sensitive region to mutation within the core was located near the C-terminus that is a focal binding site for many critical binding partners. These results indicate that core mutations may frequently cause functional defects through subtle disturbances to structure or dynamics."

            "The amino acid sequence of a protein governs its function. We used bulk competition and focused deep sequencing to investigate the effects of all ubiquitin point mutants on yeast growth rate. Many aspects of ubiquitin function have been carefully studied, which enabled interpretation of our growth analyses in light of a rich structural, biophysical and biochemical knowledge base. In one highly sensitive cluster on the surface of ubiquitin, almost every amino acid substitution caused growth defects. In contrast, the opposite face tolerated virtually all possible substitutions. Surface locations between these two faces exhibited intermediate mutational tolerance. The sensitive face corresponds to the known interface for many binding partners. Across all surface positions, we observe a strong correlation between burial at structurally characterized interfaces and the number of amino acid substitutions compatible with robust growth. This result indicates that binding is a dominant determinant of ubiquitin function. In the solvent-inaccessible core of ubiquitin, all positions tolerated a limited number of substitutions, with hydrophobic amino acids especially interchangeable. Some mutations null for yeast growth were previously shown to populate folded conformations indicating that, for these mutants, subtle changes to conformation caused functional defects. The most sensitive region to mutation within the core was located near the C-terminus that is a focal binding site for many critical binding partners. These results indicate that core mutations may frequently cause functional defects through subtle disturbances to structure or dynamics.",
            "The complexity of biological interaction networks poses a challenge to understanding the function of individual connections in the overall network. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput reverse engineering strategy to analyze how thousands of specific perturbations (encompassing all point mutations in a central gene) impact both a specific edge (interaction to a directly connected node) and an overall network function. We analyzed the effects of ubiquitin mutations on activation by the E1 enzyme and compared these to effects on yeast growth rate. Using this approach, we delineated ubiquitin mutations that selectively impacted the ubiquitin-E1 edge. We find that the elasticity function relating the efficiency of ubiquitin-E1 interaction to growth rate is non-linear and that a greater than 50-fold decrease in E1 activation efficiency is required to reduce growth rate by 2-fold. Despite the robustness of fitness to decreases in E1 activation efficiency, the effects of most ubiquitin mutations on E1 activation paralleled the effects on growth rate. Our observations indicate that most ubiquitin mutations that disrupt E1 activation also disrupt other functions. The structurally characterized ubiquitin-E1 interface encompasses the interfaces of ubiquitin with most other known binding partners, and we propose that this enables E1 in wild-type cells to selectively activate ubiquitin protein molecules capable of binding to other partners from the cytoplasmic pool of ubiquitin protein that will include molecules with chemical damage and/or errors from transcription and translation."

We recently developed the EMPIRIC approach to systematically determine the fitness effects of all possible point mutants for important regions of essential genes in yeast. Here, we systematically investigated the fitness effects of point mutations in a putative substrate binding loop of yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) over a broad range of expression strengths. Negative epistasis between reduced expression strength and amino acid substitutions was common, and the endogenous expression strength frequently obscured mutant defects. By analyzing fitness effects at varied expression strengths, we were able to uncover all mutant effects on function. The majority of mutants caused partial functional defects, consistent with this region of Hsp90 contributing to a mutation sensitive and critical process. These results demonstrate that important functional regions of proteins can tolerate mutational defects without experimentally observable impacts on fitness.",

Here, we shed light on the adaptive potential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by presenting systematic fitness measurements for all possible point mutations in a region of Hsp90 under four environmental conditions. Under elevated salinity, we observe numerous beneficial mutations with growth advantages up to 7% relative to the wild type. All of these beneficial mutations were observed to be associated with high costs of adaptation. We thus demonstrate that an essential protein can harbor adaptive potential upon an environmental challenge, and report a remarkable fit of the data to a version of Fisher's geometric model that focuses on the fitness trade-offs between mutations in different environments.",

Unfortunately, variant library expression platforms in mammalian cells are far from ideal, hindering the study of human gene variants in their physiologically relevant cellular contexts. Here, we describe a platform for phenotyping variant libraries in transfectable mammalian cell lines in two steps. First, a landing pad cell line with a genomically integrated, Tet-inducible cassette containing a Bxb1 recombination site is created. Second, a single variant from a library of transfected, promoter-less plasmids is recombined into the landing pad in each cell. Thus, every cell in the recombined pool expresses a single variant, allowing for parallel, sequencing-based assessment of variant effect. We describe a method for incorporating a single landing pad into a defined site of a cell line of interest, and show that our approach can be used generate more than 20 000 recombinant cells in a single experiment. Finally, we use our platform in combination with a sequencing-based assay to explore the N-end rule by simultaneously measuring the effects of all possible N-terminal amino acids on protein expression.",

Approximately 6% and 14% of JAK2 V617F- essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis patients, respectively, have \"canonical\" MPL exon 10 driver mutations W515L/K/R/A or S505N, which generate constitutively active receptors and consequent loss of Tpo dependence. Other \"noncanonical\" MPL exon 10 mutations have also been identified in patients, both alone and in combination with canonical mutations, but, in almost all cases, their functional consequences and relevance to disease are unknown. Here, we used a deep mutational scanning approach to evaluate all possible single amino acid substitutions in the human TpoR TMD for their ability to confer cytokine-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. We identified all currently recognized driver mutations and 7 novel mutations that cause constitutive TpoR activation, and a much larger number of second-site mutations that enhance S505N-driven activation. We found examples of both of these categories in published and previously unpublished MPL exon 10 sequencing data from MPN patients, demonstrating that some, if not all, of the new mutations reported here represent likely drivers or modifiers of myeloproliferative disease.",

Here we experimentally measure how all amino-acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein and its affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBD's surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics.

        "study_abstract": "The membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases that contain transmembrane (TM) domains and regulate the cell-surface levels of key immune-stimulatory ligands such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and the T-cell costimulatory ligand CD86. Endogenous mammalian MARCHs act on these targets to regulate antigen presentation and activation of adaptive immunity, while virus-encoded homologs target the same molecules to evade immune responses. Substrate specificity is believed to be encoded in or near the membrane-embedded domains of MARCHs and the proteins they regulate, but exactly what sequences distinguish substrates from non-substrates is poorly understood. Here we examined the requirements for recognition of the costimulatory ligand CD86 by two different MARCH-family proteins, human MARCH1 and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) modulator of immune recognition (MIR)2, using a deep mutational scanning (DMS) approach. We identified a highly specific recognition surface in the hydrophobic core of the CD86 TM domain that is required by MARCH1 and prominently features a proline at position 254. In contrast, MIR2 requires no specific sequences in the CD86 TM domain but relies primarily on an aspartic acid at position 244 in the CD86 extracellular juxtamembrane region. Surprisingly, while MIR2 recognized CD86 with a TM domain composed entirely of valine, many different single-amino-acid substitutions in the context of the native TM sequence conferred MIR2 resistance. These results show that the human and viral proteins evolved completely different recognition modes for the same substrate and reveal that some TM sequences may be incompatible with MIR2 activity even when no specific recognition motif is required.",

The design process starts with two polar amino acids that fit deep into the enzyme active site, identifies a protein scaffold that supports these residues and is complementary in shape to the lysozyme active-site region, and finally optimizes the surrounding contact surface for high-affinity binding. Following affinity maturation, a protein designed using this method bound lysozyme with low nanomolar affinity, and a combination of NMR studies, crystallography, and knockout mutagenesis confirmed the designed binding surface and orientation. Saturation mutagenesis with selection and deep sequencing demonstrated that specific designed interactions extending well beyond the centrally grafted polar residues are critical for high-affinity binding."

We combine a selection of human CXCR4 and CCR5 libraries comprising nearly all of \u223c7000 single amino acid substitutions with deep sequencing to define sequence-activity landscapes for surface expression and ligand interactions. After consideration of sequence constraints for surface expression, known interaction sites with HIV-1-blocking Abs were appropriately identified as conserved residues following library sorting for Ab binding, validating the use of deep mutational scanning to map functional interaction sites in G protein-coupled receptors. Chemokine CXCL12 was found to interact with residues extending asymmetrically into the CXCR4 ligand-binding cavity, similar to the binding surface of CXCR4 recognized by an antagonistic viral chemokine previously observed crystallographically. CXCR4 mutations distal from the chemokine binding site were identified that enhance chemokine recognition. This included disruptive mutations in the G protein-coupling site that diminished calcium mobilization, as well as conservative mutations to a membrane-exposed site (CXCR4 residues H79",

We validate SPINE with a reference single mutant dataset in the PSD95 PDZ3 domain and then characterize most pairwise double mutants to study epistasis. We observe wide-spread proximal negative epistasis, which we attribute to mutations affecting thermodynamic stability, and strong long-range positive epistasis, which is enriched in an evolutionarily conserved and function-defining network of \u2018sector\u2019 and clade-specifying residues. Conditional neutrality of mutations in clade-specifying residues compensates for deleterious mutations in sector positions. This suggests that epistatic interactions between these position pairs facilitated the evolutionary expansion and specialization of PDZ domains. We propose that SPINE provides easy experimental access to reveal epistasis signatures in proteins that will improve our understanding of the structural basis for protein function and adaptation.",

        "pub_abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in diverse cancers. Germline PTEN mutations are also associated with a range of clinical outcomes, including PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To empower new insights into PTEN function and clinically relevant genotype-phenotype relationships, we systematically evaluated the effect of PTEN mutations on lipid phosphatase activity in\u00a0vivo. Using a massively parallel approach that leverages an artificial humanized yeast model, we derived high-confidence estimates of functional impact for 7,244 single amino acid PTEN variants (86% of possible). We identified 2,273 mutations with reduced cellular lipid phosphatase activity, which includes 1,789 missense mutations. These data recapitulated known functional findings but also uncovered new insights into PTEN protein structure, biochemistry, and mutation tolerance. Several residues in the catalytic pocket showed surprising mutational tolerance. We identified that the solvent exposure of wild-type residues is a critical determinant of mutational tolerance. Further, we created a comprehensive functional map by leveraging correlations between amino acid substitutions to impute functional scores for all variants, including those not present in the assay. Variant functional scores can reliably discriminate likely pathogenic from benign alleles. Further, 32% of ClinVar unclassified missense variants are phosphatase deficient in our assay, supporting their reclassification. ASD-associated mutations generally had less severe fitness scores relative to PHTS-associated mutations (p = 7.16\u00a0\u00d7 10",

            "Determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.",

Our results highlight the differential outcome of distinct p53 mutations in human patients and elucidate the selective pressure driving p53 conservation throughout evolution. Furthermore, while loss of anti-proliferative functionality largely correlates with the occurrence of cancer-associated p53 mutations, we observe that selective gain-of-function may further favor particular mutants in\u00a0vivo. Finally, when combined with additional acquired p53 mutations, seemingly neutral TP53 SNPs may modulate phenotypic outcome and, presumably, tumor progression.",

For example, aggregates of TDP-43 occur in nearly all cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether aggregates cause cellular toxicity is still not clear, even in simpler cellular systems. We reasoned that deep mutagenesis might be a powerful approach to disentangle the relationship between aggregation and toxicity. We generated >50,000 mutations in the prion-like domain (PRD) of TDP-43 and quantified their toxicity in yeast cells. Surprisingly, mutations that increase hydrophobicity and aggregation strongly decrease toxicity. In contrast, toxic variants promote the formation of dynamic liquid-like condensates. Mutations have their strongest effects in a hotspot that genetic interactions reveal to be structured in vivo, illustrating how mutagenesis can probe the in vivo structures of unstructured proteins. Our results show that aggregation of TDP-43 is not harmful but protects cells, most likely by titrating the protein away from a toxic liquid-like phase.",

The functional characterization of variants of unknown significance within ORFs remains a major challenge for pharmacogenomics. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a high-throughput technique that makes it possible to analyze the functional effect of hundreds of variants in a parallel and scalable fashion. We adapted a \"landing pad\" DMS system to study the function of missense variants in the ORFs of cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 19 (CYP2C19). We studied 230 observed missense variants in the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 ORFs and found that 19 of 109 CYP2C9 and 36 of 121 CYP2C19 variants displayed less than ~\u00a025% of the wild-type protein expression, a level that may have clinical relevance. Our results support DMS as an efficient method for the identification of damaging ORF variants that might have potential clinical pharmacogenomic application.",

By using deep mutagenesis, mutations in ACE2 that increase S binding are found across the interaction surface, in the asparagine 90-glycosylation motif and at buried sites. The mutational landscape provides a blueprint for understanding the specificity of the interaction between ACE2 and S and for engineering high-affinity decoy receptors. Combining mutations gives ACE2 variants with affinities that rival those of monoclonal antibodies. A stable dimeric variant shows potent SARS-CoV-2 and -1 neutralization in vitro. The engineered receptor is catalytically active, and its close similarity with the native receptor may limit the potential for viral escape.",

            "Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation's effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the Escherichia coli TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code's architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.",
            "The current paradigm for tuning synthetic biological systems is through re-engineering system components. Biological systems designed with the inherent ability to be tuned by external stimuli will be more versatile. We engineered Escherichia coli cells to behave as an externally tunable band-pass filter for enzyme activity and small molecules. The band's location can be positioned within a range of 4 orders of magnitude simply by the addition of compounds to the growth medium. Inclusion in the genetic network of an enzyme-substrate pair that functions as an attenuator is a generalizable strategy that enables this tunability. The genetic circuit enabled bacteria growth to be patterned in response to chemical gradients in nonintuitive ways and facilitated the isolation of engineered allosteric enzymes. The application of this strategy to other biological systems will increase their utility for biotechnological applications and their usefulness as a tool for gaining insight into nature's underlying design principles.",
            "We introduce PFunkel, a versatile method for extensive, researcher-defined DNA mutagenesis using a ssDNA or dsDNA template. Once the template DNA is prepared, the method can be completed in a single day in a single tube, and requires no intermediate DNA purification or sub-cloning. PFunkel can be used for site-directed mutagenesis at an efficiency approaching 100%. More importantly, PFunkel allows researchers the unparalleled ability to efficiently construct user-defined libraries. We demonstrate the creation of a library with site-saturation at four distal sites simultaneously at 70% efficiency. We also employ PFunkel to create a comprehensive codon mutagenesis library of the TEM-1 \u00df-lactamase gene. We designed this library to contain 18,081 members, one for each possible codon substitution in the gene (287 positions in TEM-1 x 63 possible codon substitutions). Deep sequencing revealed that \u223c97% of the designed single codon substitutions are present in the library. From such a library we identified 18 previously unreported adaptive mutations that each confer resistance to the \u00df-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. Three of these mutations confer resistance equal to or higher than that of the most resistant reported TEM-1 allele and have the potential to emerge clinically."

High throughput sequencing allowed comparison of the mutation rate between the starting and selected library pools, enabling the generation of a stability landscape for the entire CH3 domain of human IgG1 at single residue resolution. Its quality was analyzed with respect to (i) the structure of IgG1-Fc, (ii) evolutionarily conserved positions and (iii) in silico calculations of the energy of unfolding of all variants in comparison with the wild-type protein. In addition, this new experimental approach allowed the assignment of functional epitopes of structurally specific ligands used for selection [Fc \u03b3-receptor I (CD64) and anti-human CH2 domain antibody] to distinct binding regions in the CH2 domain.",

The sensitivity of a position to mutation was strongly influenced by proximity to the phosphates of ATP, indicating that ATPase-driven conformational changes impose stringent physical constraints on Hsp90. To investigate how these constraints may vary for different clients, we performed biochemical analyses on a panel of Hsp90 mutants spanning the full range of observed fitness effects. We observed distinct effects of nine Hsp90 mutations on activation of v-src and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), indicating that different chaperone mechanisms can be utilized for these clients. These results provide a detailed guide for understanding Hsp90 mechanism and highlight the potential for inhibitors of Hsp90 that target a subset of clients.",

Here, we take an alternative approach to map functional constraints on Zika virus's envelope (E) protein by using deep mutational scanning to measure how all amino acid mutations to the E protein affect viral growth in cell culture. The resulting sequence-function map is consistent with existing knowledge about E protein structure and function but also provides insight into mutation-level constraints in many regions of the protein that have not been well characterized in prior functional work. In addition, we extend our approach to completely map how mutations affect viral neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies, thereby precisely defining their functional epitopes. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for understanding the effects of mutations to this important viral protein and also offers a roadmap for future work to map functional and antigenic selection to Zika virus at high resolution.",

However, many natural enzymes suffer from suboptimal functional expression due to poor intrinsic protein stability. Further, stability enhancing mutations often come at the cost of impaired function. Here we demonstrate an automated protein engineering strategy for stabilizing enzymes while retaining catalytic function using deep mutational scanning coupled to multiple-filter based screening and combinatorial mutagenesis. We validated this strategy by improving the functional expression of a Type III polyketide synthase from the Atropa belladonna biosynthetic pathway for tropane alkaloids. The best variant had a total of 8 mutations with over 25-fold improved activity over wild-type in E.\u00a0coli cell lysates, an improved melting temperature of 11.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b0C, and only minimal reduction in catalytic efficiency. We show that the multiple-filter approach maintains acceptable sensitivity with homology modeling structures up to 4 \u00c5 RMS.

        "pub_abstract": "Fitness landscapes depict how genotypes manifest at the phenotypic level and form the basis of our understanding of many areas of biology, yet their properties remain elusive. Previous studies have analysed specific genes, often using their function as a proxy for fitness, experimentally assessing the effect on function of single mutations and their combinations in a specific sequence or in different sequences. However, systematic high-throughput studies of the local fitness landscape of an entire protein have not yet been reported. Here we visualize an extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring the native function (fluorescence) of tens of thousands of derivative genotypes of avGFP. We show that the fitness landscape of avGFP is narrow, with 3/4 of the derivatives with a single mutation showing reduced fluorescence and half of the derivatives with four mutations being completely non-fluorescent. The narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which was detected in up to 30% of genotypes with multiple mutations and mostly occurred through the cumulative effect of slightly deleterious mutations causing a threshold-like decrease in protein stability and a concomitant loss of fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence divergence spanning hundreds of millions of years predicted the extent of epistasis in our data, indicating congruence between the fitness landscape properties at the local and global scales. The characterization of the local fitness landscape of avGFP has important implications for several fields including molecular evolution, population genetics and protein design.",

Genetic testing for sequence changes in BRCA1 frequently reveals a missense variant for which the impact on cancer risk and on the molecular function of BRCA1 is unknown. Functional BRCA1 is required for the homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks, a critical activity for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here, we describe a multiplex HDR reporter assay for concurrently measuring the effects of hundreds of variants of BRCA1 for their role in DNA repair. Using this assay, we characterized the effects of 1,056 amino acid substitutions in the first 192 residues of BRCA1. Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects on DNA repair function or on cancer predisposition, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign missense variants. We anticipate that this assay can be used to functionally characterize BRCA1 missense variants at scale, even before the variants are observed in results from genetic testing.",

        "pub_abstract": "Arrestins function as adapter proteins that mediate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization, internalization, and additional rounds of signaling. Here we have compared binding of the GPCR rhodopsin to 403 mutants of arrestin-1 covering its complete sequence. This comprehensive and unbiased mutagenesis approach provides a functional dimension to the crystal structures of inactive, preactivated p44 and phosphopeptide-bound arrestins and will guide our understanding of arrestin-GPCR complexes. The presented functional map quantitatively connects critical interactions in the polar core and along the C tail of arrestin. A series of amino acids (Phe375, Phe377, Phe380, and Arg382) anchor the C tail in a position that blocks binding of the receptor. Interaction of phosphates in the rhodopsin C terminus with Arg29 controls a C-tail exchange mechanism in which the C tail of arrestin is released and exposes several charged amino acids (Lys14, Lys15, Arg18, Lys20, Lys110, and Lys300) for binding of the phosphorylated receptor C terminus. In addition to this arrestin phosphosensor, our data reveal several patches of amino acids in the finger (Gln69 and Asp73-Met75) and the lariat loops (L249-S252 and Y254) that can act as direct binding interfaces. A stretch of amino acids at the edge of the C domain (Trp194-Ser199, Gly337-Gly340, Thr343, and Thr345) could act as membrane anchor, binding interface for a second rhodopsin, or rearrange closer to the central loops upon complex formation. We discuss these interfaces in the context of experimentally guided docking between the crystal structures of arrestin and light-activated rhodopsin.",

This phenotypic information was used to define an empirical score for each residue (RankScore), which correlated with the residue depth, and identify active-site residues.

            "Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation's effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the Escherichia coli TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code's architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.",
            "The current paradigm for tuning synthetic biological systems is through re-engineering system components. Biological systems designed with the inherent ability to be tuned by external stimuli will be more versatile. We engineered Escherichia coli cells to behave as an externally tunable band-pass filter for enzyme activity and small molecules. The band's location can be positioned within a range of 4 orders of magnitude simply by the addition of compounds to the growth medium. Inclusion in the genetic network of an enzyme-substrate pair that functions as an attenuator is a generalizable strategy that enables this tunability. The genetic circuit enabled bacteria growth to be patterned in response to chemical gradients in nonintuitive ways and facilitated the isolation of engineered allosteric enzymes. The application of this strategy to other biological systems will increase their utility for biotechnological applications and their usefulness as a tool for gaining insight into nature's underlying design principles.",
            "We introduce PFunkel, a versatile method for extensive, researcher-defined DNA mutagenesis using a ssDNA or dsDNA template. Once the template DNA is prepared, the method can be completed in a single day in a single tube, and requires no intermediate DNA purification or sub-cloning. PFunkel can be used for site-directed mutagenesis at an efficiency approaching 100%. More importantly, PFunkel allows researchers the unparalleled ability to efficiently construct user-defined libraries. We demonstrate the creation of a library with site-saturation at four distal sites simultaneously at 70% efficiency. We also employ PFunkel to create a comprehensive codon mutagenesis library of the TEM-1 \u00df-lactamase gene. We designed this library to contain 18,081 members, one for each possible codon substitution in the gene (287 positions in TEM-1 x 63 possible codon substitutions). Deep sequencing revealed that \u223c97% of the designed single codon substitutions are present in the library. From such a library we identified 18 previously unreported adaptive mutations that each confer resistance to the \u00df-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. Three of these mutations confer resistance equal to or higher than that of the most resistant reported TEM-1 allele and have the potential to emerge clinically.",
            "Nature repurposes proteins via evolutionary processes. Such adaptation can come at the expense of the original protein's function, which is a trade-off of adaptation. We sought to examine other potential adaptive trade-offs. We measured the effect on ampicillin resistance of ~12,500 unique single amino acid mutants of the TEM-1, TEM-17, TEM-19, and TEM-15 \u03b2-lactamase alleles, which constitute an adaptive path in the evolution of cefotaxime resistance. These protein fitness landscapes were compared and used to calculate epistatic interactions between these mutations and the two mutations in the pathway (E104K and G238S). This series of protein fitness landscapes provides a systematic, quantitative description of pairwise/tertiary intragenic epistasis involving adaptive mutations. We find that the frequency of mutations exhibiting epistasis increases along the evolutionary pathway. Adaptation moves the protein to a region in the fitness landscape characterized by decreased mutational robustness and increased ruggedness, as measured by fitness effects of mutations and epistatic interactions for TEM-1's original function. This movement to such a \"fitness territory\" has evolutionary consequences and is an important adaptive trade-off and cost of adaptation. Our systematic study provides detailed insight into the relationships between mutation, protein structure, protein stability, and epistasis and quantitatively depicts the different costs inherent in the evolution of new functions."

            "Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation's effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the Escherichia coli TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code's architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.",
            "The current paradigm for tuning synthetic biological systems is through re-engineering system components. Biological systems designed with the inherent ability to be tuned by external stimuli will be more versatile. We engineered Escherichia coli cells to behave as an externally tunable band-pass filter for enzyme activity and small molecules. The band's location can be positioned within a range of 4 orders of magnitude simply by the addition of compounds to the growth medium. Inclusion in the genetic network of an enzyme-substrate pair that functions as an attenuator is a generalizable strategy that enables this tunability. The genetic circuit enabled bacteria growth to be patterned in response to chemical gradients in nonintuitive ways and facilitated the isolation of engineered allosteric enzymes. The application of this strategy to other biological systems will increase their utility for biotechnological applications and their usefulness as a tool for gaining insight into nature's underlying design principles.",
            "We introduce PFunkel, a versatile method for extensive, researcher-defined DNA mutagenesis using a ssDNA or dsDNA template. Once the template DNA is prepared, the method can be completed in a single day in a single tube, and requires no intermediate DNA purification or sub-cloning. PFunkel can be used for site-directed mutagenesis at an efficiency approaching 100%. More importantly, PFunkel allows researchers the unparalleled ability to efficiently construct user-defined libraries. We demonstrate the creation of a library with site-saturation at four distal sites simultaneously at 70% efficiency. We also employ PFunkel to create a comprehensive codon mutagenesis library of the TEM-1 \u00df-lactamase gene. We designed this library to contain 18,081 members, one for each possible codon substitution in the gene (287 positions in TEM-1 x 63 possible codon substitutions). Deep sequencing revealed that \u223c97% of the designed single codon substitutions are present in the library. From such a library we identified 18 previously unreported adaptive mutations that each confer resistance to the \u00df-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. Three of these mutations confer resistance equal to or higher than that of the most resistant reported TEM-1 allele and have the potential to emerge clinically.",
            "Nature repurposes proteins via evolutionary processes. Such adaptation can come at the expense of the original protein's function, which is a trade-off of adaptation. We sought to examine other potential adaptive trade-offs. We measured the effect on ampicillin resistance of ~12,500 unique single amino acid mutants of the TEM-1, TEM-17, TEM-19, and TEM-15 \u03b2-lactamase alleles, which constitute an adaptive path in the evolution of cefotaxime resistance. These protein fitness landscapes were compared and used to calculate epistatic interactions between these mutations and the two mutations in the pathway (E104K and G238S). This series of protein fitness landscapes provides a systematic, quantitative description of pairwise/tertiary intragenic epistasis involving adaptive mutations. We find that the frequency of mutations exhibiting epistasis increases along the evolutionary pathway. Adaptation moves the protein to a region in the fitness landscape characterized by decreased mutational robustness and increased ruggedness, as measured by fitness effects of mutations and epistatic interactions for TEM-1's original function. This movement to such a \"fitness territory\" has evolutionary consequences and is an important adaptive trade-off and cost of adaptation. Our systematic study provides detailed insight into the relationships between mutation, protein structure, protein stability, and epistasis and quantitatively depicts the different costs inherent in the evolution of new functions."

Unfortunately, existing evolutionary models do not realistically represent the site-heterogeneous selection that governs actual sequence change. Attempts to remedy this problem have involved augmenting these models with a burgeoning number of free parameters. Here, I demonstrate an alternative: Experimental determination of a parameter-free evolutionary model via mutagenesis, functional selection, and deep sequencing. Using this strategy, I create an evolutionary model for influenza nucleoprotein that describes the gene phylogeny far better than existing models with dozens or even hundreds of free parameters. Emerging high-throughput experimental strategies such as the one employed here provide fundamentally new information that has the potential to transform the sensitivity of phylogenetic and genetic analyses.",

            "The innate-immune restriction factor MxA inhibits influenza replication by targeting the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Human influenza virus is more resistant than avian influenza virus to inhibition by human MxA, and prior work has compared human and avian viral strains to identify amino-acid differences in NP that affect sensitivity to MxA. However, this strategy is limited to identifying sites in NP where mutations that affect MxA sensitivity have fixed during the small number of documented zoonotic transmissions of influenza to humans. Here we use an unbiased deep mutational scanning approach to quantify how all single amino-acid mutations to NP affect MxA sensitivity in the context of replication-competent virus. We both identify new sites in NP where mutations affect MxA resistance and re-identify mutations known to have increased MxA resistance during historical adaptations of influenza to humans. Most of the sites where mutations have the greatest effect are almost completely conserved across all influenza A viruses, and the amino acids at these sites confer relatively high resistance to MxA. These sites cluster in regions of NP that appear to be important for its recognition by MxA. Overall, our work systematically identifies the sites in influenza nucleoprotein where mutations affect sensitivity to MxA. We also demonstrate a powerful new strategy for identifying regions of viral proteins that affect inhibition by host factors."

It is therefore critical to prospectively identify all vemurafenib resistance mechanisms prior to their emergence in the clinic. The vemurafenib resistance mechanisms described to date do not result from secondary mutations within BRAFV600E. To search for possible mutations within BRAFV600E that can confer drug resistance, we developed a systematic experimental approach involving targeted saturation mutagenesis, selection of drug-resistant variants, and deep sequencing. We identified a single nucleotide substitution (T1514A, encoding L505H) that greatly increased drug resistance in cultured cells and mouse xenografts. The kinase activity of BRAFV600E/L505H was higher than that of BRAFV600E, resulting in cross-resistance to a MEK inhibitor. However, BRAFV600E/L505H was less resistant to several other BRAF inhibitors whose binding sites were further from L505 than that of PLX4720.

        "pub_abstract": "Influenza is notable for its evolutionary capacity to escape immunity targeting the viral hemagglutinin. We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the \u224810(4) amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the protein's structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinin's evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenza's antigenic evolution.",

        "study_abstract": "BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino- terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a Mammalian 2-hybrid assay. Downstream of the laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that 15%-20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 45 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity plus 223 with concordant evidence in favor of benignity; these are particularly likely to be classified as Likely Pathogenic and Likely Benign, respectively, once human observational data become available.",

About 89% of the missense substitutions could be assigned clinical classifications with about 20% being pathogenic.",

KCNQ4 is one of the most commonly responsible genes for autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. According to the gnomAD cohort, approximately 1 in 100 people harbor missense variants in KCNQ4 (only variants with minor allele frequency < 0.1% were included), but most are of unknown consequence. To prospectively characterize the function of all 4,085 possible missense SNVs of human KCNQ4, we recorded the whole-cell currents using patch-clamp and categorized 1,059 missense SNVs as loss-of-function. Further, to mimic the heterozygous condition in DFNA2 (Deafness non-syndromic autosomal dominant 2) patients, we co-expressed 1,059 loss-of-function variants with wild-type KCNQ4, of which 501 variants exerted dominant-negative effects. Our functional classification is highly concordant with the auditory phenotypes in Kcnq4 mutant mice and the assessments of pathogenicity in clinical variant interpretations. Taken together, our results can provide functional evidence to support the pathogenicity classification of newly discovered KCNQ4 missense variants in clinical genetic testing.",

Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Here we use saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Functional effects for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Over 400 non-functional missense SNVs are identified, as well as around 300 SNVs that disrupt expression. We predict that these results will be immediately useful for the clinical interpretation of BRCA1 variants, and that this approach can be extended to overcome the challenge of variants of uncertain significance in additional clinically actionable genes.",

High-throughput sequencing of the pre- and postdrug challenge pools was used to count the prevalence of each variant and identify variants with abnormal function. The deep mutational scan scores identified 40 putative gain-of-function and 33 putative loss-of-function variants.

A library of 210 rhodopsin (RHO) variants from literature and in-house genetic diagnostic testing were created to efficiently detect pathogenic RHO variants that fail to express on the cell surface. This study, while focused on RHO, demonstrates a streamlined, generalizable method for detecting pathogenic VUS. A relatively simple next-generation sequencing-based readout was developed so that a flow cytometry-based assay could be performed simultaneously on all variants in a pooled format, without the need for barcodes or viral transduction. The resulting dataset characterized the surface expression of every RHO library variant with a high degree of reproducibility (r",

InDel events have important consequences in protein evolution, often opening new pathways for adaptation. However, much less is known about the effects of InDels compared to point mutations and amino acid substitutions. In particular, deep mutagenesis studies on the distribution of fitness effects of mutations have focused almost exclusively on amino acid substitutions. Here, we present a near-comprehensive analysis of the fitness effects of single amino acid InDels in TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase. While we found InDels to be largely deleterious, partially overlapping deletion-tolerant and insertion-tolerant regions were observed throughout the protein, especially in unstructured regions and at the end of helices. The signal sequence of TEM-1 tolerated InDels more than the mature protein. Most regions of the protein tolerated insertions more than deletions, but a few regions tolerated deletions more than insertions. We examined the relationship between InDel tolerance and a variety of measures to help understand its origin. These measures included evolutionary variation in \u03b2-lactamases, secondary structure identity, tolerance to amino acid substitutions, solvent accessibility, and side-chain weighted contact number. We found secondary structure, weighted contact number, and evolutionary variation in class A beta-lactamases to be the somewhat predictive of InDel fitness effects.",

        "pub_abstract": "Short insertions and deletions (InDels) are a common type of mutation found in nature and a useful source of variation in protein engineering. InDel events have important consequences in protein evolution, often opening new pathways for adaptation. However, much less is known about the effects of InDels compared to point mutations and amino acid substitutions. In particular, deep mutagenesis studies on the distribution of fitness effects of mutations have focused almost exclusively on amino acid substitutions. Here, we present a near-comprehensive analysis of the fitness effects of single amino acid InDels in TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase. While we found InDels to be largely deleterious, partially overlapping deletion-tolerant and insertion-tolerant regions were observed throughout the protein, especially in unstructured regions and at the end of helices. The signal sequence of TEM-1 tolerated InDels more than the mature protein. Most regions of the protein tolerated insertions more than deletions, but a few regions tolerated deletions more than insertions. We examined the relationship between InDel tolerance and a variety of measures to help understand its origin. These measures included evolutionary variation in \u03b2-lactamases, secondary structure identity, tolerance to amino acid substitutions, solvent accessibility, and side-chain weighted contact number. We found secondary structure, weighted contact number, and evolutionary variation in class A beta-lactamases to be the somewhat predictive of InDel fitness effects.",

        "pub_abstract": "BACKGROUND: PTEN is a multi-functional tumor suppressor protein\u00a0regulating cell growth, immune signaling, neuronal function, and genome stability. Experimental characterization can help guide the clinical interpretation of the thousands of germline or somatic PTEN variants observed in patients. Two large-scale mutational datasets, one for PTEN variant intracellular abundance encompassing 4112 missense variants and one for lipid phosphatase activity encompassing 7244 variants, were recently published. The combined information from these datasets can reveal variant-specific phenotypes that may underlie various clinical presentations, but this has not been comprehensively examined, particularly for somatic PTEN variants observed in cancers.\nMETHODS: Here, we add to these efforts by measuring the intracellular abundance of 764 new PTEN variants and refining abundance measurements for 3351 previously studied variants. We use this expanded and refined PTEN abundance dataset to explore the mutational patterns governing PTEN intracellular abundance, and then incorporate the phosphatase activity data to subdivide PTEN variants into four functionally distinct groups.\nRESULTS: This analysis revealed a set of highly abundant but lipid phosphatase defective variants that could act in a dominant-negative fashion to suppress PTEN activity. Two of these variants were, indeed, capable of dysregulating Akt signaling in cells harboring a WT PTEN allele. Both variants were observed in multiple breast or uterine tumors, demonstrating the disease relevance of these high abundance, inactive variants.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that multidimensional, large-scale variant functional data, when paired with public cancer genomics datasets and follow-up assays, can improve understanding of uncharacterized cancer-associated variants, and provide better insights into how they contribute to oncogenesis.",

Here, using genome-wide and high-density CRISPR-Cas9 \"tag-mutate-enrich\" mutagenesis screens, we identify close to full-length mutant forms of PARP1 that cause in vitro and in vivo PARPi resistance. Mutations both within and outside of the PARP1 DNA-binding zinc-finger domains cause PARPi resistance and alter PARP1 trapping, as does a PARP1 mutation found in a clinical case of PARPi resistance. This reinforces the importance of trapped PARP1 as a cytotoxic DNA lesion and suggests that PARP1 intramolecular interactions might influence PARPi-mediated cytotoxicity. PARP1 mutations are also tolerated in cells with a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation where they result in distinct sensitivities to chemotherapeutic drugs compared to other mechanisms of PARPi resistance (BRCA1 reversion, 53BP1, REV7 (MAD2L2) mutation), suggesting that the underlying mechanism of PARPi resistance that emerges could influence the success of subsequent therapies.",

Recent evidence shows the importance of epistasis in individual evolutionary pathways. However, an unresolved question in molecular evolution is how often and how significantly fitness effects change in alternative genetic backgrounds.\nRESULTS: To answer this question, we quantified the effects of\u00a0all single mutations and double mutations between all positions in the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). By observing the first two steps of all possible evolutionary pathways using this fitness profile, we were able to characterize the extent and magnitude of pairwise epistasis throughout an entire protein molecule. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach to quantitatively determine the effects of single mutations on structural stability (\u0394\u0394GU). This enabled determination of the importance of stability effects in functional epistasis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate common biophysical mechanisms for occurrences of positive and negative epistasis. Our results show pervasive positive epistasis within a conformationally dynamic network of residues. The stability analysis shows that significant negative epistasis, which is more common than positive epistasis, mostly occurs between combinations of destabilizing mutations. Furthermore, we show that although significant positive epistasis is rare, many deleterious mutations are beneficial in at least one alternative mutational background.

The atlas identifies known fAD mutations and reveals that many variants beyond substitutions accelerate A\u03b2 aggregation and are likely to be pathogenic. Truncations, substitutions, insertions, single- and internal multi-AA deletions differ in their propensity to enhance or impair aggregation, but likely pathogenic variants from all classes are highly enriched in the polar N-terminal region of A\u03b2. This comparative atlas highlights the importance of including diverse mutation types in MAVEs and provides important mechanistic insights into amyloid nucleation.",

        "study_abstract": "Thousands of proteins have now been genetically-validated as therapeutic targets in hundreds of human diseases. However, very few have actually been successfully targeted and many are considered \u2018undruggable\u2019. This is particularly true for proteins that function via protein-protein interactions: direct inhibition of binding interfaces is difficult, requiring the identification of allosteric sites. However, most proteins have no known allosteric sites and a comprehensive allosteric map does not exist for any protein. Here we address this shortcoming by charting multiple global atlases of inhibitory allosteric communication in KRAS, a protein mutated in 1 in 10 human cancers. We quantified the impact of >26,000 mutations on the folding of KRAS and its binding to six interaction partners. Genetic interactions in double mutants allowed us to perform biophysical measurements at scale, inferring >22,000 causal free energy changes, a similar number of measurements as the total made for proteins to date. These energy landscapes quantify how mutations tune the binding specificity of a signalling protein and map the inhibitory allosteric sites for an important therapeutic target. Allosteric propagation is particularly effective across the central beta sheet of KRAS and multiple surface pockets are genetically-validated as allosterically active, including a distal pocket in the C-terminal lobe of the protein. Allosteric mutations typically inhibit binding to all tested effectors but they can also change the binding specificity, revealing the regulatory, evolutionary and therapeutic potential to tune pathway activation. Using the approach described here it should be possible to rapidly and comprehensively identify allosteric target sites in many important proteins.\n",

        "study_abstract": "Genetic testing is essential for patients with a suspected hereditary myopathy. More than 50% of patients clinically diagnosed with a myopathy carry a variant of unknown significance in a myopathy gene, often leaving them without a genetic diagnosis. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type R4/2E is caused by mutations in \u03b2-sarcoglycan (SGCB). Together, \u03b2-, \u03b1-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-sarcoglycan form a 4-protein transmembrane complex (SGC) that localizes to the sarcolemma. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in any subunit can lead to LGMD. To provide functional evidence for the pathogenicity of missense variants, we performed deep mutational scanning of SGCB and assessed SGC cell surface localization for all 6,340 possible amino acid changes. Variant functional scores were bimodally distributed and perfectly predicted pathogenicity of known variants. Variants with less severe functional scores more often appeared in patients with slower disease progression, implying a relationship between variant function and disease severity. Amino acid positions intolerant to variation mapped to points of predicted SGC interactions, validated in silico structural models, and enabled accurate prediction of pathogenic variants in other SGC genes. These results will be useful for clinical interpretation of SGCB variants and improving diagnosis of LGMD; we hope they enable wider use of potentially life-saving gene therapy.",

A substantial proportion of CI deficiencies are believed to arise from defects in CI assembly factors (CIAFs) that are not part of the CI holoenzyme. The biochemistry of these CIAFs is poorly defined, making their role in CI assembly unclear, and confounding interpretation of potential disease-causing genetic variants. To address these challenges, we devised a deep mutational scanning approach to systematically assess the function of thousands of NDUFAF6 genetic variants. Guided by these data, biochemical analyses and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we discovered that the CIAF NDUFAF6 facilitates incorporation of NDUFS8 into CI and reveal that NDUFS8 overexpression rectifies NDUFAF6 deficiency. Our data further provide experimental support of pathogenicity for seven novel NDUFAF6 variants associated with human pathology and introduce functional evidence for over 5,000 additional variants. Overall, our work defines the molecular function of NDUFAF6 and provides a clinical resource for aiding diagnosis of NDUFAF6-related diseases.",

As one of the most common epilepsy-associated genes, KCNQ2 variants explosively emerge in recent years.

Here, we collected 331 clinically significant KCNQ2 variants: 145 from 232 epilepsy patients and other 186 missense variants from ClinVar database. To get enough negative controls, we also selected all 14 B/LB missense variants from ClinVar database and 43 synonymous variants with the minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than the incidence of KCNQ2-related disorders (0.0059%) from the gnomAD database as benign controls.

To understand how changes of PAX6:DNA binding cause these phenotypes, we combined saturation mutagenesis of the paired domain of PAX6 with a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay in which expression of a PAX6-GAL4 fusion gene drives antibiotic resistance. We quantified binding of more than 2,700 single amino-acid variants to two DNA sequence elements. Mutations in DNA-facing residues of the N-terminal subdomain and linker region were most detrimental, as were mutations to prolines and to negatively charged residues. Many variants caused sequence-specific molecular gain-of-function effects, including variants in position Ile71 that increased binding to the LE9 enhancer but decreased binding to a SELEX-derived binding site. In the absence of antibiotic selection, variants that retained DNA binding slowed yeast growth, likely because such variants perturbed the yeast transcriptome. Benchmarking against known patient variants and applying ACMG/AMP guidelines to variant classification, we obtained supporting to moderate evidence to suggest that 1,306 variants are likely benign, and 977, likely pathogenic. Our analysis shows that most pathogenic mutations in the paired domain of PAX6 can be explained simply by the effects of these mutations on PAX6:DNA association, and establishes Y1H as a generalisable assay for the interpretation of variant effects in transcription factors.\n",

Several mutations reduced the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Omicron BA.1 for its receptor, as expected. However, several new mutations were found which increased binding affinity, indicating the potential evolution of the virus. These mutations were clustered at several sites and caused subtle shifts to regions critical for receptor-ACE2 interactions.

Deep mutational scanning prospectively characterizes the impacts of mutations on these biochemical properties, enabling rapid assessment of new mutations seen during viral surveillance. However, the effects of mutations can change as the virus evolves, requiring updated deep mutational scans. We determined the impacts of all single amino acid mutations in the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 RBDs on ACE2-binding affinity, RBD folding, and escape from binding by the LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab) monoclonal antibody. The effects of some mutations in Omicron RBDs differ from those measured in the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 background. These epistatic shifts largely resemble those previously seen in the Alpha variant due to the convergent epistatically modifying N501Y substitution. However, Omicron variants show additional lineage-specific shifts, including examples of the epistatic phenomenon of entrenchment that causes the Q498R and N501Y substitutions present in Omicron to be more favorable in that background than in earlier viral strains. In contrast, the Omicron substitution Q493R exhibits no sign of entrenchment, with the derived state, R493, being as unfavorable for ACE2 binding in Omicron RBDs as in Wuhan-Hu-1. Likely for this reason, the R493Q reversion has occurred in Omicron sub-variants including BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75, where the affinity buffer from R493Q reversion may potentiate concurrent antigenic change. Consistent with prior studies, we find that Omicron RBDs have reduced expression, and identify candidate stabilizing mutations that ameliorate this deficit.

Because 3k and 5c are similar in structure we also deposit a combined dataset showing elucidating residues that are critical to maintaining PLpro susceptibility to both compounds.\n",

However, most variants have insufficient evidence of clinical consequences and thus limited clinical utility. Here, we demonstrate the power of variant effect mapping, which couples saturation mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing, to ascertain the function of thousands of protein coding KCNE1 variants. We comprehensively assayed KCNE1 variant cell surface expression (2,554/2,709 possible single amino acid variants) and function (2,539 variants). We identified 470 loss-of-surface expression and 588 loss-of-function variants. Out of the 588 loss-of-function variants, only 155 had low cell surface expression. The latter half of the protein is dispensable for protein trafficking but essential for channel function. 22 of the 30 KCNE1 residues (73%) highly intolerant of variation were in predicted close contact with binding partners KCNQ1 or calmodulin. Our data were highly concordant with gold standard electrophysiological data (\u03c1 = -0.65), population and patient cohorts (32/38 concordant variants), and computational metrics (\u03c1 = -0.55). Our data provide moderate-strength evidence for the ACMG/AMP functional criteria for benign and pathogenic variants. Comprehensive variant effect maps of KCNE1 can both provide insight into IKs channel biology and help reclassify variants of uncertain significance.",

The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models.

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences.

The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models.

This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences.

We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models.

Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences.

Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences. Here we present the first large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences. Here we present the first large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, with the vast majority having unknown functional consequences. Here we present the first large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the impact of >500,000 variants on the abundance of >500 human protein domains. This dataset - Human Domainome 1.0 - reveals that >60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We show how stability measurements can be combined with protein language models to annotate functional sites and that measurements made on a small number of proteins can be used to accurately predict stability changes across entire protein families using energy models. Domainome 1.0 demonstrates the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and the training and benchmarking of computational methods.",
